# SN94 miner image operations

This is a release reference, not a second mining guide. Start with the
repository [mining guide](MINING.md).

## Current image

published this digest with build provenance. Publication proves the image
artifact exists. It does not prove a miner is online or receiving weight.

## Fixed behavior

- Intel TDX only.
- Finney SN94 only.
- One public hotkey and one public HTTPS axon origin.
- A miner-owned, short-lived snapshot of current validator-permit hotkeys.
- A persistent replay and snapshot high-water database.
- An optional fleet manifest with at most 31 machines beyond the chain axon.
- No wallet, coldkey, chain RPC, snapshot-signing seed, or Cathedral API key in
  the guest.

The current image is a bounded migration bridge. Fleet discovery and protected
routes require signed validator requests. Fresh evidence and canonical audit
SAT remain public temporarily. Removing that bridge requires a new immutable
image and a reviewed rollback plan.

## One UID, several machines

The chain axon is always candidate one. Every additional entry must be a
canonical public HTTPS origin. Validators independently require a distinct
endpoint, TDX platform identity, and TLS SPKI for every counted machine.

One machine claimed through several addresses creates a hardware-identity
collision. Several machines sharing one TLS private key create a channel
collision. In either case, every verified claimant in that collision scores
zero for the round.

## Stop conditions

Do not start or keep the worker online when any of these are true:

- the image is not the exact immutable digest above, or on a host enrolled in
  signed updates, the digest the active signed release names
  (`docs/MINER_AUTO_UPDATE.md`);
- the host is not an Intel TDX guest with a usable configfs TSM report path;
- the validator snapshot is missing, invalid, or expired;
- the public-key file no longer matches its pinned digest;
- the replay database is missing or reset after its first successful creation,
  or is not owner-controlled;
- the chain axon does not match the worker hotkey, public IP, port, and protocol;
- a fleet entry reuses a hardware identity or TLS key;
- native TLS on port `8081` is not reachable; or
- the process stops refreshing evidence or answering canonical SAT.

Do not fall back to an older public image by hand. On a host enrolled in signed
updates, the updater's own rollback and `cathedral-miner-update resolve` are the
supported way back to the previous release (`docs/MINER_AUTO_UPDATE.md`).
Otherwise, fix or publish a reviewed replacement instead of reviving an obsolete
launch mode.
