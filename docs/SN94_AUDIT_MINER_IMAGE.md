# Intel TDX miner image

This page records the immutable image contract. Use the repository
[mining guide](MINING.md) for the mining sequence.

Platform: linux/amd64
Runtime contract: signed-validator-fleet-v1
```

The digest was published by GitHub Actions run
[`37065132586`](https://github.com/cathedralai/cathedral-sandbox/actions/runs/37065132586)
with build provenance and anonymous registry access. This proves the published
artifact, not a live deployment.

## Inputs

The default entrypoint accepts no arguments and exactly three Cathedral
environment values:

```text
CATHEDRAL_MINER_HOTKEY=<public Bittensor SS58 hotkey>
CATHEDRAL_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=https://<public-ip>:8081
CATHEDRAL_VALIDATOR_ACCESS_KEYS_DIGEST=sha256:<64-lowercase-hex>
```

They are public identity and integrity values. The entrypoint rejects every
other `CATHEDRAL_*` environment value.

The image fixes the remaining runtime contract:

```text
Snapshot: /etc/cathedral/validator-access/validator-access.json
Public keys: /etc/cathedral/validator-access/snapshot-keys.json
Fleet: /etc/cathedral/validator-access/fleet.json
Replay state: /var/lib/cathedral/validator-access/validator-access.sqlite
Network: finney
Subnet: 94
Validator stake floor: 0 Rao plus validator permit
Listener: native TLS on 0.0.0.0:8081
TEE: Intel TDX
```

The snapshot signer and its private Ed25519 seed stay outside the guest. The
worker receives only the signed snapshot, its public keys, the key-file digest,
and public fleet candidates.

## Attested channel

At each start, the entrypoint creates a fresh Ed25519 TLS key and self-signed
certificate inside the guest. A validator observes that TLS SPKI and requires
the fresh TDX quote to bind the same SPKI, challenge, and miner hotkey. It then
requires SAT to use the same TLS key.

The validator does not trust the self-signed certificate as a public CA
identity. It trusts the vendor-verified quote binding the live key.

The only writable host hardware mount is the guest's
`/sys/kernel/config/tsm/report` subtree. Quote collection needs to create a
report directory and write its challenge. Do not mount broader sysfs or a
wallet directory.

## Host boundary

`scripts/run_sn94_signed_fleet_miner.sh` requires the immutable digest and:

- verifies the pulled repository digest, platform, and runtime label;
- mounts config read-only and replay state separately;
- uses a read-only container filesystem and a bounded TLS tmpfs;
- drops Linux capabilities and blocks privilege escalation;
- applies process, memory, swap, file-descriptor, and shutdown limits;
- installs one dedicated nftables table for TCP `8081`; and
- removes only its container and dedicated table on exit.

These controls limit ordinary misuse and connection pressure. They do not
prove DDoS resistance or which image a remote host runs. Fresh attestation is
the remote proof.

## Temporary compatibility bridge

The current image invokes the bounded `public-legacy-audit` migration posture.
It keeps fresh evidence and canonical audit SAT public while fleet discovery
and all non-public routes require signed validator requests. Operators cannot
change this posture through environment variables.

Moving to signed-only `worker serve` requires a new reviewed image. Do not
describe the current digest as signed-only.

## Build contract
